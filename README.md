# Unreal-Graffiti

### Introduction
This is a Python and Arduino based project in which you can use your computer's webcam to paint anything you want on your screen using an Arduino based spray can built by us. We implemented this in Python using OpenCV. 

What our script dooes is detect the largest blue object captured by the webcam and use it to paint different objects. We made our spray can such that it has a blue light with which you can paint. The spray can contains a joystick which when pressed acts as the spray button. You can also change the colours using the joystick.

graffiti.py contains the code for the detection and painting along with using the signals sent by the spray can.
graffiti_p.py contains the code just for the detection and painting without the arduino.

We lost the Arduino Code for this project.

This project was built as Project 2 for the IED Course in Semester 2 by the team - Squirtle Squad.

Squirtle Squad consists of the following members:
1) Pankil Kalra
2) Ansh Kumar Sharma
3) Mohnish Agrawal
4) Arjun Lakhera
